# Physic Playground

This repository contains an SFML-based learning project that explores core concepts of game development, including a minimal engine architecture and basic physics mechanics.

The engine allows dynamic interaction with simulated objects, such as adding, removing, accelerating, and slowing down balls.
A second project, AstroGame, aims to expand on these concepts by introducing a spaceship game, but it is currently work in progress.
